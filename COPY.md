## 0) HERO (first screen)
**Headline:** [What they buy + outcome in one line]  
**Subheadline:** [What changes after delivery]  

**Price:** [$____ fixed]  
**Delivery:** [____ business days]  

**CTA:** [Approve / Book call / Start]  

**Proof (1–3 bullets):**
- [Proof #1]
- [Proof #2]
- [Proof #3]

---

## 1) THE ELEPHANT (name it bluntly)
**You already have:** [e-shop + robotics conviction]  
**Missing:** [audience + repeatable content engine]  

**What goes wrong without a system:**
- [Problem #1]
- [Problem #2]
- [Problem #3]

**One-liner:** [This package fixes that by giving you a system + backlog + decision rules.]

---

## 2) OUTCOME (what “done” looks like)
After this package you will have:
- [Output #1 (tangible)]
- [Output #2 (tangible)]
- [Output #3 (tangible)]
- [Output #4 (tangible)]
- [Output #5 (tangible)]

**So you can:** [run content weekly without guessing]

---

## 3) GOALS + PLAN (Option C: Now vs Next)

### Now (first 30 days): build the content engine
- [Primary channel + secondary channel decision]
- [Find 1–2 repeatable winners]
- [Set decision rules (scale / improve / kill)]
- [Define measurement (what we track weekly)]

### Next (scale): grow and compound
- [Increase volume of winners]
- [Repurpose: one insight → multiple assets]
- [Add platforms only after proof]
- [Automation later, only what earns it]

---

## 4) WHY THIS WILL NOT LOOK GENERIC (3 bullets)
- [We do X, not Y]
- [We do X, not Y]
- [We do X, not Y]

(Example pattern: “not reposts → takeaways”, “repeatable formats → not one-offs”, “metrics → not taste”)

---

## 5) HOW WE THINK (optional — 3 lines max)
- [Principle #1]
- [Principle #2]
- [Principle #3]

(Delete if it turns into a manifesto.)

---

## 6) HOW WE WORK (high-level — 3 bullets)
- [Explore: where we look + what we analyze]
- [Choose: what we decide + how we narrow]
- [Define: what we measure + how decisions get made]

---

## 7) WHAT YOU GET (separate page / tabs)
> Keep this as tabs on the site.  
> Each tab must be: **What it is → Why it matters → What decision it enables**.

**Tabs (choose 6–9):**
- [Tab 1]
- [Tab 2]
- [Tab 3]
- [Tab 4]
- [Tab 5]
- [Tab 6]
- [Tab 7]
- [Tab 8]
- [Tab 9]

Mini-template for each tab:
- **What it is:** [1 sentence]
- **Why it matters:** [1 sentence]
- **Decision it enables:** [1 sentence]

---

## 8) METRICS (what we track, tied to decisions)
**We track:**
- Attention signals: [____, ____, ____]
- Trust signals: [____, ____, ____]
- Buyer-intent signals: [____, ____, ____]

**Decision loop:**
- If [signal up] → [scale]
- If [signal flat] → [change hook/packaging]
- If [signal dead after enough tries] → [cut]

(No thresholds here. Keep the exact numbers inside the package.)

---

## 9) WHAT HAPPENS AFTER (roadmap, no pricing)
- [Pilot: execute selected strategies → weekly review]
- [Double down winners / cut losers]
- [Scale: increase volume + repurpose + add platforms after proof]
- [Automation later: only for what’s proven]

---

## 10) WHY US (proof)
- [Proof #1]
- [Proof #2]
- [Proof #3]

---

## 11) GUARANTEE + NEXT STEP
**Guarantee:** [1–2 lines, specific]  
**Next step:** [Approve → invoice → kickoff]
