# Where we are today and where we wanna get

At Laniameda, we believe in **begin-with-the-end-in-mind** approach.
So let us reverse engineer what success means.

- Affiliate partnerships with robotics brands

---

## 3. How we are gonna get there?

We're going to reach the Long-Term Win through a series of four Short-Term Wins, each building on the foundation of the previous one.

### Roadmap to Success

| Quarter | Title | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| M1-2 | Seed & Reach | Build audience engine through repeatable content formats |
| M3-5 | Content-Market Fit | Attract the right avatar |
| M6-9 | Growth | Scale production across platforms using automation |
| M9-12 | Scale | Mass production, full monetization, brand independence |

---

## Win #1: Seed & Reach (Month 1–3)

**Goal:** Build an audience engine through repeatable content formats that drive consistent reach and views.

At this seed stage, we focus on **reach and views first** to establish a funnel for our ideal avatar. We test proven content formats from robotics and adjacent niches, adapted to our brand voice and narrative.

We focus on repeating what already works to get engagement and views, however we do that with already established brand visuals and narrative, so that we keep the high standards of the brand from the beginning.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Pieces | 50-100 |
| Hero formats | 1-2 |
| Followers | 5K-10K |
| Views | avg 10K |

### Platform Strategy

- **Instagram (Hero)**
- **LinkedIn (Support)**

### Distribution Plan

**70/20/10:** proven / iterate / experimental

**Gate to Win #2:** 10K avg views + 5K followers with consistent format

---

## Win #2: Content-Market Fit (Month 3–6)

Win #1 gave us reach. Now we focus on attracting the right people.

**Goal:** Find content that attracts not just views, but our Ideal Customer Avatar we outlined.

We're now shifting from mass reach to targeted attraction. We want to attract followers who align with our brand values and are likely to become customers.
We intentionally position the brand through our Brand Narrative Bible, to attract the ICPs.

Our messaging answers:

- What we stand for (i.e robots are 'second-dog')
- What we're against(i.e robots are evil)
- The transformation we promise (i.e no more uncertainty about robots)

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Followers | 10K-20K |
| Engagements | 15%+ |
| E-shop clicks | 100+ |

### Platform Strategy

At this step we focus on having one hero platform, and one support platform. We distribute our focus in 70/30%. Once we establish escape velocity, we change the hero platform

- **Instagram (Hero)**
- **LinkedIn (Support)**

Once Instagram hits escape velocity (10K+ views), we shift focus to [XYZ] without splitting attention.

### Content Distribution Plan

**70/20/10:** What works / better / new

**Gate to Win #3:** People being to follow for value, clear ICP correlation, first e-shop conversions

---

## Win #3: Growth & Multi-Platform (Month 6–9)

Win #2 gave us fit. Now we double down on it.

**Goal:** **Scale without dilution:** squeeze maximum leverage from proven formats that already attract *the right* audience.

Win #3 operationalizes what already works. The objective is **scale what brings in ideal avatars** and not attention/views

This means taking what worked in Content Market Fit and building systems to produce it at scale.

This is the time where we heavilly invest in AI automations. Based on the type of content that actually drives core KPIs, we build a solution around it, not the other way.

### What success looks like:

- 3-4 active platforms with consistent content
- Repurposing engine operational (1 idea -> 5-7 pieces)
- AI pipeline handling 30-50% of production
- 50K-75K total followers across platforms

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Followers | 50-75K |
| Monthly views | 300-500K |
| Posts/week | 60-70 |
| Engagement | 20%+ |

### Distribution Plan

**70/20/10:** proven / optimize / moonshots

### Platform Expansion

Maintain focus:

- Instagram (Running) → TikTok (Hero) → YouTube Shorts

Once [XYZ] hits escape velocity ([followers/views]), shift primary focus to [ABC] while [XYZ] lives in maintenance mode.

### Repurposing Engine

One source enters the pipeline and exits as seven platform-native assets with minimal manual overhead.
We can do that efficiently, because we manually discovered what is actually working, for our audience in our niche for our brand.

### AI Automation Strategy (Agentic System)

At this stage, we have a **strict content production system** and have identified formats that actually perform for our ICPs-content that drives leads. This clarity allows us to bring in an **agentic system** to optimize production of proven content types.

By automating the 70% (proven formats), we effectively **pop this element from our focus distribution**—freeing attention for moonshots and experimental formats. Example: *AI-generated cinematic series about robots in family life*.

These moonshots require a more manual approach and are less scalable-but that's fine. The automated engine backs us with consistent results, allowing us to pursue high-cost creative directions we identified during discovery but initially flagged as risky. **At this point, they're no longer risky.**

This also opens an adjacent marketing channel: AI filmmaking and generative media content intersects directly with our robotics ICPs while tapping into a growing creator niche.

---

## Win #4: Scale & Enterprise (Month 9–12)

We're now operating at enterprise scale - mass content production with maintained quality, fully activated monetization, and brand independence.

**Goal:** **Mass production, full monetization, brand independence, creative and high value content production engine: cinematics, short series, live action, UGC.** All platforms run simultaneously with automated repurposing and platform-specific optimization.

### Platform Portfolio

| Platform | Status | Followers | Mode |
|----------|--------|-----------|------|
| Instagram | Established | 30K+ followers | Autopilot |
| TikTok | Established | 25K+ followers | Autopilot |
| YouTube Shorts | Active growth | 20K+ subscribers | Growth |
| LinkedIn | B2B presence | 10K+ followers | Autopilot |
| Emerging | Testing | Threads | Experiment |
| X | Testing | 30k followers | Growth |

### Scale Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Followers | 100K+ |
| Automation | 70%+ |
| Pieces/week | 35+ |
| Human time/week | 2-3h |

Here at this step the AI pipeline with the human in the loop produces 70% of content. **that allows the brand to scale moonshots and double down on creative, high quality type content**

those may be a fully Ai generated films about robots in family lifes, Comedy, Live action storytelling etc

### Content Distribution Strategy (80%/20%)

**80% Automated proven formats**
AI brutefroces production, repurposing, distribution.

**20% High value creative content**
AI generated documentaries, Mini series, education (via robot like avatar), Robotic AI UGC influencers, etc

### Moonshot Example: "Robots in Real Life" Series

**2-3 minute cinematic shorts** created with generative AI tools. Follows families using robots to reclaim time for what matters — emotional cinematic storytelling, on scale.

- [Laniameda](https://www.laniameda.space/) produces and promotes in AI filmmaking communities
- Drives brand differentiation and respect.
- Bi-weekly release schedule for consistent audience engagement

**Final State:** Scalable content business, tailored for high value audience, generating revenue through e-shop traffic, affiliate partnerships, and brand deals.

## The Compound Effect

Each phase is engineered to build on the previous

| Pillar | Win #1 | Win #2 | Win #3 | Win #4 | = Final State |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
| AUDIENCE | Views to drive algorithms | 10k-20k followers, ICP attraction | 75K multi-platform | 100K loyal advocates | High-value audience on trust |
| BRAND | Voice + visuals defined | Positioning and narrative | Cross-platform consistency | Compound effect | Emotional connection and trust |
| BUSINESS | first CPA metrics | Improve CPA <= clear ICP | Partnerships emerge | Active revenue streams | Diversified streams of revenue |
| INDEPENDENCE | Built system, playbook | Own what works | Scale what works | Explore with no risks | Freedom in formats |

---

## Define your content strategy first.

- If you don't know what type of content to post to get views, you will not get enough to funnel in the right avatar.
- If you skip brand narrative and positioning, you have no chance to attract the audience you want.
- If you can't attract the right avatar, you have no stable way to scale across platforms.
- If you don't have a decision-making system and blueprint from the beginning, you end up on a random walk — spending time on ideation instead of execution.
