# Phase 2: Pilot (Seed Stage)

Spin up the content wheel to get reach.

At this stage, we use the creative treatment strategy, to systematically produce content to get views and engagement.

---

## What Happens

- We create a visual design system: How Reels editing looks like, how carousels look like - create visual language based on the brand narrative and visual references identified in the creative treatment package
- We take 3 formats from the top ranked content formats from the content library from the creative treatment package
- We put 70% of our efforts on the first one in the list
- We test two platforms. Hero and Support (i.e Reels+LinkedIn)
- Observe data. Switch the formats if not working, by taking the next format from the creative treatment table
- Actively engage with the audience in comments/platforms

---

## Execution & Volume

This stage runs for approximately **4+1 weeks**. We aim for:

- **2 content pieces/day** for the Hero platform
- **1 content piece/day** for the Support platform
- That's **3 per day, 21 per week, 84 per month**

We iterate and adjust formats continuously to achieve an average of **10K+ views** per piece. Target metrics will be defined in the creative package, and we optimize by switching formats until we hit those targets. Once achieved, we shift toward more valuable content types.

At this stage, everything is done **manually** — no heavy AI automation. We test the pipeline by hand to learn what works and what doesn't. [Laniameda](https://www.laniameda.space/) fully covers content production and distribution.

## Deliverables

1. **80+ Content Pieces** — 84 pieces per month across Hero and Support platforms
2. **Data collected** — What worked, what didn't, what formats to double down, what to cast away
3. **Refined content strategy** — Updated based on real data

## Outcome

**Content engine in place, visual and narrative brand parts in place, views and reach established.**
