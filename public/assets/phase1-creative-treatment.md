## What The Package Delivers

- Hypotheses Content Library
- Brand Narrative & Positioning
- Prioritization System
- Content Pillars
- Visual Direction
- Pilot → Scale Roadmap

---

## 1. Hypotheses Content Library

*10-20 ranked content ideas*

A ranked library of content directions from robotics and adjacent niches (AI, business, lifestyle etc). This becomes your content backlog - start at the top, test highest-probability ideas first, track outcomes, iterate. Don't spend time on deciding what form of content to make. **Have clarity beforehand about what content you are gonna produce.**

### What's Inside

- Content type: News, carousels, memes, cinematic stories, trends, tutorials, etc
- Platform: Where each type performs
- Reference links: References to the content types
- Adaptation notes: how to repurpose into our (robotics) niche
- Complexity: How resource consuming production wise each type is
- Tools to use: if adapt, what tools to use (generative AI)
- Efficiency projection: Expected reach and engagement, based on the references
- Priority: Ranked 1-100 by probability of success weighted by efforts and alignment with the current phase (Seed, Content Market Fit, Growth)

### Example Content Library Entries

| Rank | Content Type | Description | Platform | Complexity | Priority Reason |
|------|--------------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | News Breakdown | "Robot company X announced Y" with a quick breakdown | Instagram Reels | Low | Proven in tech niche, 50K avg views, low production effort |
| 2 | Product Review | I tested this robot for 30 days, here's what happened | TikTok | Medium | High engagement in consumer tech and strong trust signal |
| 3 | Day in Life | How a robot saves me 2 hours daily | Instagram Reels | Medium | Emotional and practical angle with strong saves |

## 2. Brand Narrative & Positioning

*Brand kernel*

A tight brand identity document that defines who you are, what you believe, and how you communicate - so every piece of content reinforces the brand and attracts the ideal avatars.

### 1. Brand Narrative (30-sec pitch)

> i.e. Everyone in the niche talks about how cool robot's features are. None talks about what really matters behind all the features - the time you buy back to spend creatively.

### 2. Positioning Framework (example)

- **Stand for:** Robots will be second dogs to families
- **Against:** robots are about tech and features
- **Promise:** you will never feel lost in the niche of robotics with us

*We'll explore multiple positioning directions together and lock in the one that truly resonates with your brand story.*

### 3. ICP Definition

- **Internal:** "I feel lost in the robotics niche"
- **External:** "The choices are overwhelming"
- **Transform:** "Get clarity, status and affiliation by staying in the loop of the frontier of robotics"

### 4. Messaging Rules

Words to use/avoid, tone guidelines

### Application Example

"Top 5 robot vacuum features" → "5 ways robot vacuums give you time back (and 2 features that don't)."

---

## 3. Prioritization System

*Focus area*

A focused execution plan that tells you exactly where to **concentrate effort** so we don't dilute attention by trying everything at once.

### Hero Platform and Content Type [example]

- **Platform:** Instagram Reels
- **Format:** AI generated talking head explaining robotics news

### Support System

- **Platform:** LinkedIn
- **Format:** Branded Carousel

### Additional Elements

- **Moonshot test (high value high cost):** High-production AI driven cinematic short film
- **Cadence:** 5 [Hero] + 3 [Support]
- **When to add [Another platform]:** Add [XYZ platform] after [HERO] reaches [Y] followers, [Z] avg views, and one proven repeatable format

---

## 4. Content Pillars

*4-6 themes*

Recurring narrative formats that we stick to, based on the brand narrative, the stage we are currently in (content pillar on stage Seed is different from stage Content Market Fit) that works in adjacent niches, and how to repurpose them in robotics niche.

### 01. Robotics News
- **Role:** Education
- **Description:** Fast news breakdowns focused on real consumer impact.
- **Examples:** News in robotics, Feature implications

### 02. Tutorials on how to be more productive
- **Role:** Education
- **Description:** Practical guides on AI tools.
- **Examples:** how to do [X], use this prompt to

### 03. Memes
- **Role:** Entertainment
- **Description:** Videos that catch attention
- **Examples:** CCTV footage of robot at home

### 04. Robot Reviews
- **Role:** Product
- **Description:** Clear comparisons and reviews that drive confident choices.
- **Examples:** [T100] vs [T1000]

---

## 5. Visual Direction

*Reference system*

A canvas of the reference editing styles, colors, brand assets, layouts for different content pillar and type, examples of other creators in the niche, in adjacent niches that we can take inspiration from, carousels examples.

### Do
- Clean typography
- Premium editing layout for reels/carousels

### Don't
- Overuse of effects
- Slop cheap style

### Content Type Styles

| Type | Style |
|------|-------|
| News posts | Fast cuts, on-screen text, energetic music |
| Educational | Slower pacing, clear visuals, explanatory voice |
| Emotional | Cinematic b-roll, soft music, minimal text |

---

## 6. Execution Roadmap

*90-day plan*

A precise step by step plan of actions on what to do at each step, based on the collected content library, locked in brand narrative. A strategic document that explains how to leverage this research and strategy in the upcoming phases.

### Stage 1: Seed (Days 1-30)
*Prioritize engagement and views*

a) Take content format `[X]` from the Content Library based on max rank prioritization for Seed stage.

b) Post it on `[Hero Platform]` in `[N]` quantity. Post content type `[C]` on `[Support Platform]`.

c) Use the proposed **Visual Design System** to maintain premium feeling from the beginning.

d) Monitor metrics: `[Target Metric]` at `[Threshold]`.

e) Metrics below target? → Switch content type to `[NEXT]` from Content Library. Keep Hero and Support platforms.

f) Metrics reached? → Shift distribution to **70%** `[NEW FORMAT]` (from Content Library), **20%** `[OLD FORMAT]` for testing.

---

### Stage 2: Validation (Days 31-60)
*Confirm right audience is arriving*

a) Verify: Are the **right people** coming in? Check `[Qualification Criteria from ICP Definition]`

b) Quality signals met? → Start expanding to `[Platform Z]` using same content formats.

c) Introduce **Moonshot content** `[1x per timeframe]` to test high-production value.

---

### Stage 3: Content-Market Fit (Days 61-90)
*Systematize what works*

a) Lock in the **proven content system**: formats, posting rhythm, visual style.

b) Document `[SOPs]` for content production based on winning patterns.

c) Transition to **Win #2**: `[Specific goal - leads/sales/community]`.

## The Failure Logic

### How to Fail — Skip Discovery

**Seed stage:**
- Random content, random walk with no system in place
- No understanding what content really works at each stage

**Content market fit stage:**
- No clear understanding who your avatar is — content that does not provide value
- No value, no real (targeted) followers

**Result:**
- Inconsistency in content production
- Ambiguity on what content drives real KPIs
- Decision fatigue

---

### Start with Discovery

**Week 1-2:**
- Clear blueprint that outlines the whole brand journey from 0 to 1
- Ready to be executed plan of actions
- Understanding where we go, and how we will get there

**Month 1-3:**
- Gain attention and views first, based on the beforehand established system and decision making pipeline
- The content preserves premium feel because of consistent efforts put in visual style
- Content that brings in right avatars, based on the established brand narrative
- Freedom to automate what already works, and shift attention to more high-risk high-reward content

**Result:**
- Content engine that works because it's reverse engineered
- Scalable system that allows to invest in premium content type, and by extent increasing brand value

---

## Without Discovery

You try 5 platforms at once → diluted effort → none gain traction → abandon after 6 months when results don't materialize.

---

## Discovery → Win #1 (Seed stage) Connection

Each deliverable directly enables Win #1. Without it - ambiguity.

| Deliverable | Enables Win #1 | Without It |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Content Library | 10-20 ranked ideas → test high-probability formats first to capture desired metric (reach first) | Spend time on ideating, test what should not be tested |
| Brand Positioning | Sets long term vision bar, that ideal avatars can fit themselves in | Attract everyone (yet it's okay for this stage) |
| Prioritization System | Keep consistency by planning, rapid decision making when switching between formats | Second guessing if the format is right, overthinking options, wasting time |
| Visual Direction | Consistency in premium vibes from first post - signals consistent premium brand | Looks amateur |
| Content Pillars | Stick to themes that work in the niche | Waste time reinventing the wheels on stage 0 |
