---

## 3. How We're Going to Get There

We're going to reach the Long-Term Win through a series of four Short-Term Wins, each building on the foundation of the previous one.

### Roadmap to Success

| Quarter | Phase | Description | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **M1-2** | Seed & Reach | Build audience engine through repeatable content formats | In Progress |
| **M3-5** | Content-Market Fit | Attract the right followers — ideal customers who buy | Upcoming |
| **M6-9** | Growth | Scale production across platforms using automation | Upcoming |
| **M9-12** | Scale | Mass production, full monetization, brand independence | Upcoming |

---

## Win Details: The Four-Phase Journey

### Win #1: Seed & Reach
**Month 1–3**

> **Goal:** Build an audience engine through repeatable content formats that drive consistent reach and views.

At this seed stage, we focus on **reach and views first** to establish a funnel for our ideal customers. We test proven content formats from robotics and adjacent niches, adapted to our brand voice and narrative.

We focus on repeating what already works to get engagement and views, however we do that with already established brand visuals and narrative, so that we keep the high standards of the brand from the beginning.

**Success Metrics:**
- **50-100** pieces
- **1-2** hero formats
- **5K-10K** followers

**Platform Strategy:**
- Instagram (Hero) + LinkedIn (Support)

**Distribution Plan:**
70/20/10: proven / iterate / experimental

**Gate to Win #2:** 10K avg views + 5K followers with consistent format

---

### Win #2: Content-Market Fit
**Month 3–6**

> **Goal:** Find content that attracts not just views, but our Ideal Customer Portraits we locked in during the discovery phase.

Win #1 gave us reach. Now we focus on attracting the right people.

We're now shifting from mass reach to targeted attraction. We want to attract followers who align with our brand values and are likely to become customers. We intentionally position the brand through our Brand Narrative Bible, to attract the ICPs.

Our messaging answers:
- What we stand for (belief system)
- What we're against (contrarian stance)
- The journey we're inviting customers into
- The transformation we promise

**Success Metrics:**
- **20K-30K** followers
- **15%+** engagement
- **20%+** save rate
- **100+** e-shop clicks

**Platform Strategy:**
- Instagram (Running) + TikTok (Hero)

Once Instagram hits escape velocity (10K+ views), we shift focus to TikTok without splitting attention.

**Distribution Plan:**
70/20/10: winners / brand story / moonshots

**Gate to Win #3:** 15%+ engagement, clear ICP correlation, first e-shop conversions

---

### Win #3: Growth & Multi-Platform
**Month 6–9**

> **Goal:** Scale without dilution: squeeze maximum leverage from proven formats that already attract the right audience.

Win #2 gave us fit. Win #3 builds scale without burning out the founder.

Win #3 operationalizes what already works. The objective is **scale with quality**, not noise: create one strong idea, then ship platform-native versions with speed and consistency.

The system must still run when the founder is not in day-to-day operations. AI and workflows handle repetition, while humans stay focused on strategy, partnerships, and community.

**Success Checkpoints:**
- 3-4 active platforms with consistent content
- Repurposing engine operational (1 idea -> 5-7 pieces)
- AI automation handling 30-50% of production
- 50K-75K total followers across platforms
- Scalable content system that does not require founder's daily involvement

**Key Metrics:**
- **50-75K** followers
- **300-500K** monthly views
- **10-15** posts/week
- **12%+** engagement

**Distribution Plan:**
70/20/10: proven / optimize / moonshots

#### Platform Expansion (Priority Queue)
Instagram (Running) → TikTok (Hero) → YouTube Shorts

Once TikTok hits escape velocity (15K+ followers, 20K+ views), shift primary focus to YouTube Shorts while TikTok moves to maintenance mode.

#### Repurposing Engine (1 idea → 7 assets)

**Source Signal:** 3 ways robots save families 10 hours per week

**Outputs:**
1. Instagram Reel (9:16 vertical)
2. TikTok (optimized hook for FYP)
3. YouTube Short (optimized title/description)
4. Instagram Carousel (text takeaways)
5. LinkedIn Carousel (professional angle)
6. Newsletter snippet (email nurturing)
7. Twitter/X thread (micro-content)

**Packaging Blueprint (adapt-per-platform):**
- Reel: Fast-paced montage + on-screen text
- TikTok: Same video, hook adjusted for TikTok
- YouTube Short: Same video, metadata optimized
- Carousel: Static images with detailed breakdown
- LinkedIn: Professional productivity angle
- Newsletter: Deep-dive + product recommendations
- Twitter/X: 5-post thread with key points

#### AI Automation Strategy (Agentic System)

At this stage, we have a **strict content production system** and have identified formats that actually perform for our ICPs—content that drives leads, not just attention. This clarity allows us to bring in an **agentic AI system** to optimize production of proven content types.

By automating the 70% (proven formats), we effectively **pop this element from our focus distribution**—freeing attention for moonshots and experimental formats. Example: *AI-generated cinematic series about robots in family life*.

These moonshots require a more manual approach and are less scalable—but that's fine. The automated engine backs us with consistent results, allowing us to pursue high-cost creative directions we identified during discovery but initially flagged as risky. **At this point, they're no longer risky.**

This also opens an adjacent marketing channel: AI filmmaking and generative media content intersects directly with our robotics ICPs while tapping into a growing creator niche.

**Automated Lane:**
- Script generation from pillars + brand voice
- Visual creation (thumbnails, graphics, b-roll)
- Editing assistance (cuts, captions, transitions)
- Repurposing between formats (Reel -> Carousel)
- Scheduling recommendations

**Human Lane:**
- Strategy and ideation
- Brand voice refinement
- Community engagement
- High-value content (moonshots, partnerships)

#### How We Measure Success

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Multi-platform reach** | Total views/impressions across all platforms |
| **Production efficiency** | Content output vs. time invested |
| **Automation success** | % of content produced with AI assistance |
| **Partnership interest** | Inbound brand inquiries |
| **Revenue signals** | E-shop traffic from content, affiliate clicks |

**Gate to Win #4:** Repeatable multi-platform growth, stable engagement above 12%, and measurable inbound partnership demand.

---

### Win #4: Scale & Enterprise
**Month 9–12**

> **Goal:** Mass production, full monetization, brand independence. All platforms run simultaneously with automated repurposing and platform-specific optimization.

We're now operating at enterprise scale — mass content production with maintained quality, fully activated monetization, and brand independence.

#### Platform Portfolio

| Platform | Status | Followers | Mode |
|----------|--------|-----------|------|
| Instagram | Established | 30K+ followers | Autopilot |
| TikTok | Established | 25K+ followers | Autopilot |
| YouTube Shorts | Active growth | 20K+ subscribers | Growth |
| LinkedIn | B2B presence | 10K+ followers | Autopilot |
| Emerging | Testing | Threads, X video | Experiment |

#### Scale Metrics

- **100K+** followers
- **70%+** automation
- **35+** pieces/week
- **2-3h** human time/week

#### AI Automation (70%+ of Production) — Full System

**Fully Automated (70%):**
- Daily content: AI generates Reels, Shorts, Carousels
- Repurposing: 1 idea → 7+ formats automatically
- Scheduling: AI posts at optimal times
- Performance: AI analyzes metrics, suggests iterations
- Moderation: AI handles comments, flags for review

**Human Attention (30%):**
- Strategic content: Moonshot films (bi-weekly)
- Partnership content: Sponsored posts (1-2/week)
- Community depth: DMs, Live sessions
- Creative direction: Brand evolution, new pillars

**Example Workflow: Monday Morning**
1. Human strategist selects 5 topics from content library
2. AI generates scripts, visuals, and edits 5 videos
3. Human reviews and approves (20 min)
4. AI repurposes each into 7 formats = 35 pieces total
5. AI schedules across platforms for the week

#### Content Distribution Strategy — Final 70/20/10

| Split | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **70%** | Automated proven formats | AI handles production, repurposing, distribution. News, tutorials, product reviews, "day in the life" content. |
| **20%** | Strategic iterations | A/B test new hooks, optimize for emerging platforms, refine monetization CTAs. |
| **10%** | Premium moonshot content | Cinematic episodic series, high-production storytelling, influencer collaborations, event coverage. |

#### Moonshot Example: "Robots in Real Life" Series

**2-3 minute cinematic shorts** created with generative AI tools. Follows families using robots to reclaim time for what matters — emotional storytelling with practical product integration.

- Laniameda produces and promotes in AI filmmaking communities
- Drives brand differentiation and respect
- Bi-weekly release schedule for consistent audience engagement

#### Final State

**Scalable content business**, not dependent on founder, generating revenue through e-shop traffic, affiliate partnerships, and brand deals.

## The Compound Effect

Each phase is engineered to build on the previous. Skip steps = failure.

| Pillar | Win #1 | Win #2 | Win #3 | Win #4 | = Final State |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
| **AUDIENCE** | 10K followers, engagement habits | 30K ICPs, community forming | 75K multi-platform | 100K loyal advocates | High-value audience on trust |
| **BRAND** | Voice + visuals defined | Positioning validated | Cross-platform consistency | Independent recognition | Emotional connection established |
| **BUSINESS** | First clicks proven | Traffic patterns clear | Partnerships start | Active revenue streams | Dual monetization model |
| **INDEPENDENCE** | Playbook documented | Repurposing built | 50% automated | 70% automated, team runs it | Not founder-dependent |

---

## Why You Can't Skip Steps

| Skip | Result |
|------|--------|
| **Win #1** | No proven format → scale random content → waste $10K–20K |
| **Win #2** | Wrong audience → monetization fails (they don't buy) |
| **Win #3** | Stuck on 1 platform → algorithm change kills you |
| **Win #4** | Still founder-dependent → business dies if you step away |
