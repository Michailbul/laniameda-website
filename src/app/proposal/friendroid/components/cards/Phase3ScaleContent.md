At this stage, we are shifting our attention towards a more value approach and building the connection with the audience instead of chasing reaches while gradually bleeding in this more valuable content for users.

## Value-Driven Content Foundation

This valuable content — more value-driven content — we already have in place because we already outlined this idea in the strategic creative treatment package where we tagged this content type as educational and we have a set of ideas that we might be working on, might grab and implement based on our research previous in discovery package.

For example, such thing would be like creating the talking avatar head, creating talking avatar head that explains how to use AI tools or generative AI tools using the branded colors or branded character of the Friendroid brand visuals.
