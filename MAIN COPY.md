--STAGE1---

## Creative Treatment Package — $2,000 
**Purpose:** Entry step to build a </highlighted connected, trusted> audience in the robotics niche and monetize it via e-shop. 

**Delivery:** 5 business days  
**Scope:** strategy + system + decision rules *(not content production)*  
**Outcome:** content strategy

---

# Section Current state (today)
What you have:  **e-shop**  
What you don’t have: **audience + repeatable branded high quality content engine** to monetize the audience


# Section We believe
The right way to build a brand is to provide value to the audience. 
Value can be emotional </highlighted-scrolled status, affiliation, connection > and practical </highlighted-scroll klnowledge, skills> 

# Section Problem -
No audience
No value delivery content strategy 


---STAGE2---

# Solution 
Create a content engine that drives engagement and reach while maintaining a high-quality brand style, providing value to users and establishing brand connection.

To spin this up we offer the Creative treatment discovery package.

“In 2–3 weeks we’ll design your content engine: what to say, how to package it, where and what to publish, how to measure winners  - so you can grow consistently without guesswork.”

# Section Deliverables - What you get — multi-tab view
> Use this as tabs on a web page.  
> Each tab is a pair: **Problem statement → Deliverable**

## Tabs (Array)
1) **Problem:** “There is so much different content out there. We don’t know what to post, and what prioritize first”  
**Deliverable:** **Hypotheses Content Library (ranked)**

**What it is:**  
A ranked table of content directions pulled from the robotics niche (and adjecent ones), so you have a clear set of directions to execute.

**What’s inside**
- Content type (news / carousel / meme / cinematic / viral / educational)
- Platform
- Reference links (videos / carousels / posts that already work)
- Adaptation instruction (how to adapt it to use in your brand)
- Complexity to implement (low / medium / high)
- Tools to use to implement (AI tools, if applicable) so you know how to make it.
- Metrics to track (per content type)
- Efficiency projection
- Priority order (what to test first)


### Tab 2 — Prioritization System
**Problem:** “We dont have a consistency system in place”.
You see a viral video, news, cinematic high quality content. You are lost, trying to implement all of that at once. You need stable repeatable system that you can measure.

**Deliverable:** **Prioritization System**
**What it is:**  
A focused starting setup so you don’t try everything at once.

**What’s inside:**
- Primary channel + secondary channel recommendation.
- Hero format (main growth engine)
- Support format
- 1–2 controlled experiments (limited on purpose)
- Publishing cadence guidance (what goes out, how often)

Example: 
Hero format - AI talking head, explaining news in robotics (Reels)
Support format - carousel with key takeaways (Inst+LinkedIn)



### Tab 3 

**Problem** - we dont have strategy (we dont know what and why to post) There is so much oportunities that we are overwhelmed with options, and unclear on what would drive real results. 

A clear strategy that defines *what we’re building*, *who it’s for*, and *how content turns into audience* (not just posts).

**What’s inside:**
- **Audience definition:** who we’re speaking to (primary audience + secondary audience)
- **Content pillars:** 4–6 repeatable themes that the brand owns (identified on the Hypotheses content library stage)
- Strategy on how to build a trusted brand without personal brand 
- Strategy on how to turn engagement into valuable metrics (conversions to follows, saves, interaction with brand)
- 4-6 content pillars -
**How you use it:**
- It becomes the “north star” for the Hypotheses Library and Starting System
- It prevents random posting and keeps the brand building in one direction
- It makes distribution and repurposing coherent (same idea, different packaging)

**Result:**  
A single, focused strategy that turns content into audience growth with a clear path to trust and e-shop demand.
Clear action points list on what to do each day


### Tab 4 — Repurposing Blueprint
**Problem:** “Scaling is hard”  
**Deliverable:** **Repurposing Blueprint**

**What it is:**  
A practical map for converting one topic into multiple pieces without re-inventing the wheel, adhering to the suggested content hypotheses.

**What’s inside:**

**How you use it:**  
One topic/theme fuels multiple posts and keeps output consistent with less effort.


### Tab 5 — Brand Kernel
**Problem:** - We want to establish a high agency long term brand, but we lack clarity on what the brand stands for, so that we would be able to make an elevator pitch.

<cursive>If you want to be more then a reailer - you need to establish a brand.
A brand is a set of pairings, rules, beliefs.</cursive>

**Deliverable:** **Brand Kernel**

**What it is:**  
A tight identity block that keeps content, messaging, and actions recognizable and coherent.

**What’s inside:**
- Brand narrative story hook (that can be told in 30 seconds). 
- **Positioning:** 
-- “What we stand for” (1–2 строки)
-- “What we’re against” (1–2 строки)
-- Promise (why stay with us)

- Why?
So that each content piece reinforces the connection with brand in the users brain.


**How you use it:**  
Every content piece goes through the lense of brand narrative and positioning. 
Every connection with the audience maps to the story "hero - problem - guide - plan - success".


**Example:**
"Every robotics brand talks aout the specs anf features. We at friendroid think differently. We believe that the sole purpose of robots is to help people with everyday routine, so that they can spend their time creatively, with their loved ones, or on things that matter"
"we understand how hard it is for you to [PROBLEM], thats why we created this [SOLUTION] that will help you [ACHIEVE SUCCESS] without [FAILURE]


### Tab 6 — Visual Direction *(not full brand design)*
**Problem:** “Visuals drift and look inconsistent.”  
**Deliverable:** **Visual Direction** — set of references of visual editing and design style.

**You get:**
- A reference set for captions, UI/layout
- A short **do / don’t** list (what makes the brand look cheap)

**Result:** an understanding at what direction the branded content production would be leaning in, before we get to doc ontent brand design itself

7) **Problem:** “We don’t know what ‘working’ means.”  
   **Deliverable:** **Metrics + Decision Rules** — what to track weekly + scale/improve/kill loop.

8) **Problem:** “What happens after this?”  
   **Deliverable:** **Pilot → Scale Roadmap** — step-by-step next phase plan *(no pricing here)*.
